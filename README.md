##Known errors
I tested the code on python linter which checks the code for any mistakes and blunders. On line 209 it says its over-indented, but when it is not over-intended and everything is all clear the game does not run and an error occurs. When it comes to guessing the coordinates of the enemies battleship. If you put in a key other then a number it will stop the game and you will have to run the programm again.
